 Just a simple accordion faq list. When you hover over the <dt> it reveals the <dd> using the small snippet of jQuery. Nothing to fancy with the jQuery, just used the filter method to target all the <dd> except the first occurence with the :nth-child(n+4) selector. Also added some text-shadow to give the text a stamped looked and other CSS3 goodies.
